### Bitflasher: Bitcoin Flashing Instructional Program

Bitflasher is an instructional program designed for Bitcoin flashing services. It allows users to send Bitcoin using a hash key generated by an unidentified miner. The FlashBTC application ensures complete safety and anonymity for its users.

**Software Overview:**

- **Phony Bitcoin Transfers**: Bitflasher enables the transfer of fake Bitcoins across blockchain networks. These Bitcoins can remain in a wallet indefinitely if they lack a hash rate. However, Bitcoins with a hash rate are valid for a maximum of 60 days before being automatically rejected by the blockchain and eventually disappearing.
